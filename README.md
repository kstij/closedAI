# Basic-Chatbot
  
## About this project
In this Python project I have built a simple chatbot using deep learning techniques. 
The chatbot is trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. I have used a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then give a random response from the list of responses.
